            <h2>Department of Undergraduate Education (DUE) Web Internship</h2>
            <b>Kylee Dicken</b>
            <p>It has nearly been a year since I began as a Web Intern with DUE in May of 2023. In that time I have been able to experience different ways my studies in Web Development can be used towards digital communcations. From website management systems to building emails to user experience and accessibility, I have learned many tools.</p>

            <p>Each day there are a couple of typical tasks to complete. The most important first is any open tickets in <a href="#servicenow">Servicenow</a>. We will first send the tickets ID into the team's ticket <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> channel so everyone knows someone is working on it. Then, we use the various tools we have, like <a href="#wcms">WCMS</a> or <a href="#salesforce">Salesforce</a>, to complete the request and communicate with the client further when needed. Once there are no open tickets, we can then work on any upcoming projects assigned in <a href="#basecamp">Basecamp</a>. These projects typically include creating an email in <a href="#salesforce">Salesforce</a> or build the page for a  <a href="https://honors.iupui.edu/news-events/_stories/faith-odiete.html">news story</a> created by a content intern.</p> 
            <p>I am very grateful to this internship for all it has taught me over this year here. From the various little tips and tricks to the major experiences with not only different systems and tools, but life-skills as well. There are many things I have taken from here and use frequently now on my own, like all of the keyboard shortcuts I wouldn't had learned about otherwise, how to make websites accessible for everyone the ways of styling content on the web to be reusable chunks that keep a website looking consistent. I now feel much more capable than I did previously.</p>

                <h3>Content Management System (WCMS)</h3>
                <b>Website managment tool</b>
                <br><br>
                <p>The Web Content Management System (WCMS) is Indiana University's website managment tool built from <a href="https://www.hannonhill.com/products/cascade-cms/index.html">Hannon Hill's Cascade CMS</a>. It is one of the main tools used at DUE as it is what is used to create, edit, publish and manage the over 30 individual websites overseen by the office.
                </p><p>
                WCMS was something new coming from studying and writing code ourselves as the system is more form based, similar to something like <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>. In WCMS each page is built with some settings, like display name, navigation, or banner, then sections with chunks inside of those sections. There are many different kinds of chunks like text, images, accordions, videos, feeds, etc.
                </p>
                <p>I found it very interesting how websites were set-up here and I've began using it in my own websites. It is very useful to know how to manage websites on such a large scale for something as big as a university.</p>

                <b>Email communications creation and sending</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Salesforce is the system used to not only build, but send mass communication emails out as well. I had not built emails prior to learning salesforce here, but I quickly enjoyed the process. I was surprised to learn they can be built just like any website. Emails are made with an IU Framework, using many pre-built chunks designed to work for all devices which are able to be pieced together and added to.

                <p>Servicenow is used to manage any requests sent to DUE Communications, referred to as tickets. These include requests for the communications side, typically assigned to DUE.COMM, and web support tickets, typically assigned to DUE.WEB. Web support tickets can include many various things from uploading/updating digital signage, making updates to a webpage or a person's profile, managing the access to certain people, uploading videos for captioning, adding or removing pages/content on websites or even sending out an email.

                <h3>Basecamp</h3>
                <b>Projects and documentation management</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> is an extremely helpful tool as it performs many functions which help keep not only myself, but the whole office organized. The two main features I use most frequently include viewing any upcoming project assignments I need to complete and searching the tons of documentation created by the office for any questions I may have.
                </p>
                <p>
                Basecamp has individual tabs for each project created where everyone working on the specific project and the files for it can be added. The most common projects I recieve here are creating an email in <a href="#salesforce">Salesforce</a> or build the page for a  <a href="https://honors.iupui.edu/news-events/_stories/faith-odiete.html">news story</a> created by one of the Content Interns. The most helpful feature here is being able to break-down everthing into individual to-dos and assigning them to people with due dates which are displayed on an 'upcoming assignments' for that person. Because of Basecamp, I always know what I need to be working on and I never feel lost.
                </p>
                <p>These individual project tabs are not only used for each project but they also hold the main spaces for the web and communications teams in the office. In these are many folders of documentation for everything the office does which is extremely helpful for any task that may require a refresher, especially the ones done not super frequently like uploading videos or accessing the internal files, like <i>.htaccess</i>, of a website.</p>
